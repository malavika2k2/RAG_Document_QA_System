# RAG_Document_QA_System
 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built to answer questions on any given document. This project demonstrates a complete AI pipeline that retrieves relevant information using a vector database and embeddings, then uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to synthesize a final, conversational answer.
